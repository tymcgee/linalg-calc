# linalg-calc
A calculator for various linear algebra-related operations.

# Example

# Notes
In creating this calculator I learned a lot:
- How to use both the `tk` and `qt` graphical libraries in python
- How to do symbolic math with fractions, and in doing so learned more about creating and using classes
- More about how to split projects across multiple files to make the project cleaner (still working on this one)
- How to implement various linear algebra/matrix operations
- And much more!

I don't know exactly when I'll consider this project _fully_ done.. every once in a while I'll think of something to try, add, or change, and I'll come back and work on it for another while. In general, though, I think this project is mostly done (although I reserve the right to come back and rewrite the whole thing in the future!). If I ever learn a new language, like C++ for example, I may try to re-write this in that language as a way to learn more about it.

# Requirements
To run `calc_qt.py`, you need `PySide6` and `numpy`:
```
pip install pyside6 numpy
```
To run `calc.pyw` (in the tk_version folder), you need `tkinter` (which is probably already installed) and `numpy`:
```
pip install numpy
```
